# f3k-analyzer
A comprehensive analyzer for simultaneous logs for f3k launch and flght analysis
F3K Session Analyzer is for digging into discus launch glider (DLG) flight logs.
Drop in a bunch of your CSVs (or even a whole ZIP of them) and it’ll:
	•	Line up all your sessions so the first launch starts at the same time
	•	Spot each throw and mark the peak altitude
	•	Show you an interactive graph you can zoom, pan, and poke at
	•	Give you tables with max heights, durations, climb rates, and more
	•	Summarize each session so you can see your best throws and overall trends
	•	Let you download all the throw data with your own notes and tags

It’s basically a flight diary and scoreboard rolled into one, perfect for comparing training days, trying different setups, or just geeking out over numbers.
